## Lab Setup
In order to prepare for the git init workshop, there are few components you require.
1. Git
Please follow the instructions listed here [Git Install](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

2. GitHub account
Before you can use GitHub, you need a GitHub account. Registration can be found here [GitHub Join](https://github.com/join)

3. IDE/Text Editor
A good text editor or IDE can make working with Git a breeze, I prefer VSCode, but to each their own!
